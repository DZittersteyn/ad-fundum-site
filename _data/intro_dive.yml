  experience with scubadiving, but you want to get a feel for our club? No problem!
  Just sign up for an introduction dive or contact us and we'll get you introduced!
  There are no introdives this year, in case you are still interested in diving, contact
  us and we'll see whether we can arrange something.\n\n#### Dates\n\nWe have introdives
  again in January/February. Exact dates will follow later. If the available dates
  do not suit you, contact us and we'll arrange something (note that we can only have
  an actual introdive on Mondays, this is when we have time available in the pool). Introdives
  start at 18:30, but beforehand we'll have an introduction, explanation and time
  to change into swimming gear, so we start with all that at 17:30.  \n_*Not available
  on the date(s) above? Contact us to discuss the possibilities!_\n\n### The only
  things you need to bring are:\n\n* Towel\n* Swimclothing\n\nWe will bring the rest.
  \n*_Bringing your own diving material is possible, but not required._"
